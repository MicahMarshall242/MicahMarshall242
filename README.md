# ✌️  Hello, I'm Micah.
I'm a developer, designer, and builder. I'm a second-year computer science student passionate about writing clean and effective programs, games, and apps. I am a fanatic for clean APIs and cohesive subsystems, with a desire to write code that **feels** alive.

##  🔨 Skills
- **[IDEs]** IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, VSCode, DataGrip
- **[Languages]** Python, Java, Kotlin, SQL, some CSS
- **[FrameWorks]** JavaFX, Korge, LWJGL, OpenGL (via LWJGL) Logic Pro (audio)
  
## ♟ Hobbies
I have many hobbies. While I love to code, catch me on my downtime and you'll find that I'm creating a new music track in Logic Pro, or that at Roller World practicing a new backward skating technique. Other times, I may be playing piano, or you'll find me on a hiking trail, or in the general outdoors exploring, doing photography, biking, or swimming. When I'd rather sit at home, you'd find me either on Minecraft playing competitive gamemodes such as bedwars, skywars, or duels, or on other games like Lethal Company or Terraria.

## 💻 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 **[Chess Engine]**
I'm currently working on my third chess engine iteration. In this iteration, I'm shifting to a more performant piece representation and move generation. I've put a large focus on following **Object Oriented Design** principles to have a cleaner codebase and ensure future extensibility.

- 🌲 **[Survivalist]**
In June, I began migrating a survival game I made in Scratch to a Kotlin program via Korge. The rebuilt version is going to stray pretty far from the original idea, but many aspects will be the same. Survivalist is a wilderness survival game that takes place on an island, and you must scavenge the land to find resources, craft tools, weapons, and armor, all while maintaining your hunger, thirst, health, temperature, and staying safe from hostile creatures.

- 🎮 **[Simple 2D Game Engine]**
While developing Survivalist, I ran into a problem — I couldn’t hide the mouse pointer and replace it with my own. So, being the ambitious person I am, I decided to build my own game engine instead 😝. I could've spent a few hours diving into Korge's source code to figure out how to hide the cursor, but I wanted an excuse to put my own understanding and skills to the test. While I didn't like halting Survivalist’s development, I didn't regret opening this door. It's given me the chance to dive deeper into **graphics programming**, **OS-level systems**, and **design of infrastructure**.
