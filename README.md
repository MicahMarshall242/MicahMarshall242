# ✌️  Hello, I'm Micah.
I'm a developer, designer, and builder. I'm a second-year computer science student passionate about writing clean and effective programs, games, and apps. I am a fanatic about clean APIs and cohesive subsystems, with a desire to write code and systems that are clearer than ice.

##  🔨 Skills
- **[IDEs]** IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, VSCode, DataGrip
- **[Languages]** Python, Java, Kotlin, SQL, some CSS
- **[FrameWorks]** JavaFX, Korge, LWJGL, OpenGL (via LWJGL) Logic Pro (audio)
  
## ♟ Hobbies
I have many hobbies. While I love to code, during my downtime, you'll find me creating a new music track in Logic Pro or practicing a new backward skating technique at Roller World. Other times, I may be playing piano, or be halfway up a hiking trail, or somewhere outdoors exploring, taking pictures of what I find, biking, or swimming. When I'd rather sit at home, you'd find me playing competitive Minecraft game modes such as Bedwars, Skywars, or Duels. If not Minecraft, I'll be on other games like Lethal Company or Terraria.

## 💻 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 **[Chess Engine]**
I'm currently working on my third iteration of my chess engine. In this iteration, I'm shifting to a more performant piece representation and move generation. I've set my focus on following **Object Oriented Design** principles to cultivate a cleaner codebase and ensure future extensibility.

- 🌲 **[Survivalist]**
In June, I began migrating a survival game I made in Scratch to a Kotlin program via Korge. The rebuilt version will stray significantly from the original idea, but many aspects will be the same. Survivalist is a wilderness survival game that takes place on an island, and you must scavenge the land to find resources, craft tools, weapons, and armor, all while maintaining your hunger, thirst, health, temperature, and staying safe from hostile creatures.

- 🎮 **[Simple 2D Game Engine]**
While developing Survivalist, I ran into a problem — I couldn’t hide the mouse pointer and replace it with my own. So, being the ambitious person I am, I decided to build my own game engine instead 😝. I could've spent a few hours diving into Korge's source code to figure out how to hide the cursor, but I wanted an excuse to put my own understanding and skills to the test. While I didn't like halting Survivalist’s development, I didn't regret opening this door. It's given me the chance to dive deeper into **graphics programming**, **OS-level systems**, and **infrastructure design**.
